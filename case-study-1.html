                    <p>E&S Power System Solutions is a local solar energy company. They have been in operation for over 10 years and has never had a website.</p>
                    <p>I designed, built and hosted their website to support their online marketing efforts and to set them apart from competitors. Additionally, I will be offering SEO marketing services and optimize search engine indexing to boost traffic to their website.</p>

                    <div class="text-content">
                       <p>While building this application, these are some of the challenges I faced:</p> 
                       <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Hosting:</h3>
                                <p>Inexperienced in publishing and hosting a .Net Core application, I encountered difficulties understanding the required steps.</p>
                                <p>Initially, I published the files to a folder and uploaded them to the hosting provider, expecting the application to run. However, it did not. After seeking guidance from online resources, I tried publishing the application while running on IIS, following which, the application successfully ran.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Database integration:</h3>
                                <p>Connecting the application to the hosting provider's database posed challenges post-publishing. Despite successfully connecting to the database server via SQL Server Management Studio, updating the database locally resulted in persistent errors.</p>
                                <p>Resolving the issue, I discovered an incorrect connection string as the root cause, rectifying which enabled proper database functionality.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Email Client:</h3>
                                <p>Configuring an email client using Google's SMTP proved to be more time-consuming than expected. After dedicated efforts and troubleshooting for a few hours, I eventually succeeded in setting up a functional email client.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>  
                    </div>

                    <h2>Summary and Reflections</h2>
                    <p>Reflecting on these challenges, not only have I learnt a lot but I have gained valuable insights into the importance of thorough research, proper configuration, and persistence in troubleshooting to overcome obstacles encountered during website development.</p>
